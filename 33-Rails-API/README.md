# Rails API
- Dynamic web pages with JS front end and Rails backend
- Single page application (with various request-response cycles)

### Why not use json-server forever?
- Use relationship between models
- Manage large database (update/add rows)
- Respond with request for data with data (json)

### Getting Started
- Plan! Draw out your wireframes and models
- Build vertically

`rails new <app_name> --api --database=postgresql`

### Useful Rails Commands
- `rails g model user`
- `rails db:migrate rails db:seed`
- `rails g controller user`

### CORS
- Cross Origin Resource Sharing

### Serializers

##### Custom Serializers

### CRUD
 - We can Read
 - Let's now Create
 - How would we do Update or Delete?
