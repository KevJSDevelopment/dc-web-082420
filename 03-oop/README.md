* Create instance methods
* Call methods on the implicit or explicit `self`
* Define attribute readers and writers using `attr_` macros
* Explain the need for variable scope and why it's important to not utilize global variables

## Questions

* math equations
* attr_accessors
    * when would you use them?
    * how do you customize them?
    * why would use just the read or write over the accessor
* self vs instance variables
    * when would self be the better one to use
